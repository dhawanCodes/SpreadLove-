        <h3>Founder Name</h3>

        <p>
            The idea behind Spread Love 💖 was born from a simple belief —
            the world becomes better when love is shared freely.
            This platform was created to inspire people, celebrate emotions,
            and build a community driven by kindness and respect.
        </p>

        <p>
            With a passion for creativity and technology, the founder
            envisioned a space where emotions meet innovation, and
            people from all walks of life feel connected.
